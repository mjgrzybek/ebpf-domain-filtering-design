# Introduction
This design document presents an overview of the system, outlining its architecture, capabilities, and technical implementation details. The CI/MON system is designed to offer users the ability to detect and prevent unknown network connections, thereby enhancing the security posture of their systems.

By leveraging the power of eBPF, the CI/MON system provides granular control over network traffic, allowing users to define custom rules for filtering connections based on various criteria. 

the CI/MON system runs in "detect" mode for passive monitoring or "prevent" mode for proactive blocking against unauthorized access and malicious activities.
